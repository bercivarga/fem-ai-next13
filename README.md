⚠️ This project is a work in progress.

This is a practice project. The goal is to build an app that has a complete authentication flow and a clear MVP feature set. The app is meant to function as a daily journal which uses a semantic AI model to analyze user's daily mood, then offer reports on them.

Goals for the MVP app are:

- Authentication functionalities with Clerk's Next.js SDK
- Journal entry management with Prisma and a PostgreSQL database (hosted on Railway)
- Mood analysis (AI solution TBD)
- (Optional) Host the project on Netlify's edge
